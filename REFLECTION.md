Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I picked activities that match a typical day for me, like scrolling TikTok in bed, going to class, and producing music in FL Studio. I also made it playful with emojis and relatable moments to keep it fun.

What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
I initially had some events overlapping because I wasn’t spacing out the setTimeout delays enough. Once I increased the timing between them, the flow felt more natural.

What does this assignment teach you about async code?
It shows that asynchronous code doesn't follow the usual top-to-bottom logic. setTimeout lets you schedule events independently, which feels more like real-world time, where actions happen with delays.

What creative element did you add?
I added a twist by using a randomized “mood” emoji at night to simulate the unpredictability of how I might feel by the end of the day. It made the simulation feel a bit more human.

How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
It captures the rhythm of a daily routine, but unlike real life, it’s totally predictable (except for the mood). In real life, tasks often overlap or get interrupted, which is harder to simulate in this format.
